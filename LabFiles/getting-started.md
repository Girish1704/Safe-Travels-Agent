# Build and Enhance a Safe Travels Agent with Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will build and configure a Safe Travels Agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio to assist employees with travel planning, policy queries, and approval workflows. The agent leverages multi-agent orchestration to seamlessly delegate specialized tasks, such as leave balance inquiries, to a dedicated Leave Manager Agent. By integrating with Microsoft Teams and Power Automate, you will create an intelligent, automated system that enhances employee experience and streamlines business processes.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- **Create and Deploy Safe Travels Agent:** Build a travel assistance agent using templates, integrate knowledge sources, and deploy to Microsoft Teams.

- **Implement Agent Flows for Business Automation:** Design and configure Power Automate flows that trigger travel approval processes and post notifications to Teams channels.

- **Build Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Create a specialized Leave Manager Agent and enable collaboration between multiple agents for comprehensive business solutions.

- **Test End-to-End Workflows:** Validate agent responses, flow executions, and cross-agent handoffs to ensure reliable operation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Understanding of Conversational AI and Agentic AI Concepts
- Working Knowledge of Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Familiarity with Microsoft Teams and Power Platform

## Explanation of Components

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** Platform to build, configure, and manage conversational AI agents.

- **Dataverse:** Central data store for employee information, leave balances, and travel policies.

- **Power Platform Environment:** Secure workspace hosting agents, data tables, and workflows.

- **Power Automate:** Workflow automation engine for travel approval processes and Teams integration.

- **Microsoft Teams:** Collaboration hub where users interact with agents and receive approval notifications.

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Framework enabling specialized agents to work together and route requests intelligently.
