# Build and Enhance a Safe Travels Agent with Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

In this focused hands-on lab, you will learn to build intelligent conversational agents using Microsoft Copilot Studio and explore multi-agent orchestration concepts. Starting with the Safe Travels agent template, you'll create and customize an AI agent that provides travel assistance to employees, then enhance it with basic business process automation and multi-agent capabilities.

This practical lab is designed to be completed in exactly 60 minutes, focusing on the most essential skills: agent creation, Teams integration, and a taste of multi-agent orchestration. You'll get hands-on experience with Microsoft's latest AI technologies while building something genuinely useful for business scenarios. By the end, you'll have a working travel assistant agent deployed to Teams, plus understand how agents can work together to solve complex problems.

## Objective

Learn essential AI agent development using Microsoft Copilot Studio in just 1 hour. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Create and Deploy AI Agents:** Build a working Safe Travels agent from template, customize it with knowledge sources, and successfully publish it to Microsoft Teams for real-world use.

- **Integrate with Business Processes:** Create a basic Agent Flow that automates travel approval requests and posts them to Teams channels, demonstrating practical business automation.

- **Understand Multi-Agent Concepts:** Experience how specialized agents can work together by adding a simple Leave Manager agent and seeing multi-agent orchestration in action.

- **Deploy to Enterprise Platforms:** Successfully publish your agents to Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot, making them accessible to end users in familiar environments.

## Pre-requisites

- **Microsoft 365 Admin Tenant Credentials** with appropriate permissions for Copilot Studio and Teams administration
- **Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio** environment with agent creation and publishing permissions
- **Microsoft Teams** access for testing and deployment of published agents
- **Basic understanding** of conversational AI concepts and Microsoft 365 collaboration tools
- **Familiarity with business process automation** and enterprise workflow requirements

## Architecture

You'll complete a focused two-exercise journey that delivers maximum value in 60 minutes:
