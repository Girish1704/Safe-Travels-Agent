# Exercise 1: Create Safe Travels Agent and Deploy to Microsoft Teams

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this foundational exercise, you'll create your first AI agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio's Safe Travels template. This is a practical, hands-on introduction to conversational AI that will give you a working travel assistant agent deployed to Microsoft Teams by the end of 30 minutes.

The Safe Travels agent will help employees with travel-related questions, policy information, and guidance. You'll see how easy it is to create powerful AI agents using templates, test them thoroughly, and deploy them to your organization's collaboration platform.
